## Future enhancements

I am mostly focusing on the way android application is develop and not spent more time on creating attractive UI for now.

1. Loading list of hotels with limit and using paging library
2. Adding search bar to search in the list
3. Using jetpack compose to create UI
4. Creating impressive UI checking with UI team 
5. Adding UI test using espresso and many more..
